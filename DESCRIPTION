Description: Implements a novel method for privatizing network data using differential privacy. Provides functions for generating synthetic networks based on latent space models (LSM), applying differential privacy to network latent positions to achieve overall network privatization, and evaluating the utility of privatized networks through various network statistics. The privatize and evaluate functions support both LSM and random dot product graphs (RDPG). For generating RDPG networks, users are encouraged to use the 'randnet' package.

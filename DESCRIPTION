Description: Implements the GRAND (Graph Release with Assured Node Differential Privacy) 
    method for privatizing network data using differential privacy. The package provides 
    functions for generating synthetic networks, applying differential privacy to network 
    latent positions, and evaluating the utility of privatized networks through various 
    network statistics.

Description: GRAND (Graph Release with Assured Node Differential privacy) is an R package 
    that implements a novel method for privatizing network data using differential privacy. 
    The package provides functions for generating synthetic networks based on LSM 
    (Latent Space Model), applying differential privacy to network latent positions to achieve 
    overall network privatization, and evaluating the utility of privatized networks through 
    various network statistics. The privatize and evaluate functions support both LSM and 
    RDPG (Random Dot Product Graph). For generating RDPG networks, users are encouraged 
    to use the 'randnet' package.

\title{Generate Latent Space Model Network}
\usage{
LSM.Gen(n, k, K, avg.d = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. Number of nodes in the network.}

\item{k}{Integer. Dimension of the latent space.}

\item{K}{Integer. Number of communities/groups.}

\item{avg.d}{Numeric. Target average degree. If NULL, no degree adjustment is performed.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item A: Adjacency matrix of the generated network
  \item g: Graph object of the generated network
  \item P: Probability matrix of the generated network
  \item alpha: Node-specific intercept parameters
  \item Z: Latent positions in k-dimensional space
  \item idx: Community assignments for each node
}
}
\description{
Generates a random network following the Latent Space Model (LSM) with specified parameters.
  The LSM assumes that each node has a latent position in a k-dimensional space, and edge probabilities
  depend on the distances between these latent positions.

\details{
Generate Latent Space Model Network


  The Latent Space Model generates networks based on the following process:
  \enumerate{
    \item Node-specific intercept parameters: \code{alpha[i] ~ Uniform(1, 3)}, then transformed as \code{alpha[i] = -alpha[i]/2}
    \item Community assignments: Each node is randomly assigned to one of K communities with equal probability
    \item Latent positions: \code{Z[i,] ~ MVN(mu_g[i], I_k)} where \code{mu_g[i]} is the community center for node i's community
    \item Community centers: \code{mu_g ~ Uniform sphere} of radius 3 in k-dimensional space
    \item Edge probabilities: \code{P[i,j] = logit^{-1}(alpha[i] + alpha[j] - ||Z[i,] - Z[j,]||)}
    \item Adjacency matrix: \code{A[i,j] ~ Bernoulli(P[i,j])} for i < j, with \code{A[i,i] = 0}
  }
  If \code{avg.d} is specified, the edge probabilities are scaled to achieve the target average degree.

\examples{
# Generate a network with 500 nodes, 2D latent space, 3 communities
result <- LSM.Gen(n = 500, k = 2, K = 3)
# Generate with target average degree of 50
result <- LSM.Gen(n = 500, k = 2, K = 3, avg.d = 50)
